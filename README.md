Traffic Simulation
==================

A project to simulate traffic jams in a one-dimensional traffic lane.

You can see the [simulation in action][7].

Motivation
----------

A friend, who is a mathematics teacher for high school students, asked if I could create
a simple traffic model which exhibits typical traffic jams.

The simulation should be easily usable by people without programming experience. The simulation
should provide a means of the behaviour of the traffic by specifying the indiviual responses of
the cars.
